    <h1>Homework 9: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Per Capita By Country Choropleth</h1>
    <h2>Grace Parker</h2>
    <h3>This map shows the carbon dioxide emissions per capita by country of the world. This choropleth uses natural breaks that I have tweaked to facilitate reading. The data comes from the World Bank. I cleaned the data to remove unnecessary information, allowing the page to be lighter and faster. When joining the CSV and vector file, I initially had many more null values. I had to edit the country code names to standardize them. For example, the United States code was "USA" in the CSV but "US1" in the vector file. The choropleth shows, as expected a higher per capita emissions in developed Western countries. African nations generally have the lowest per capita emissions. While the US, Australia, and the United Kingdom have among the highest. Nations like China and India, although they have high emissions, also have a large population and therefore do not rank among the highest per capita emissions shown in this map.</h3>
