    <h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth</h1>
    <h2>Grace Parker</h2>
    <h3>My map shows the median income of full-time, year-long workers that are age 16+ in New York by county. The chloropleth categorizes the median incomes by natural breaks. The darker purple shows a greater median income as defined in the legend. The data comes from the US Census, which provides additional data about the median income by gender and industry. I removed this data from the csv file to make the data lighter and faster to view. I cleaned the data in order to join it to the New York counties vector file. I used an attribute query to limit this vector file to only New York counties, since it orginally showed all counties in the U.S.</h3>
