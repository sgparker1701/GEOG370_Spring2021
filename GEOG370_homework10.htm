    <h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing</h1>
    <h2>Grace Parker</h2>
    <h3>This map uses geoprocessing to create original layers. I used buffers, dissolves, and intersections in this map. A five and three mile buffer were created around various features a potential resident may be interested in living close to. These include beach accesses, parks, and the hospital. I queried the NC county map to select only Carteret County and created its own layer. I dissolved the boundaries within the NC county map to get only an outline of the entire state. I used data from the Carteret County Open Data webpage to locate the features of interest. Then, I created a buffer for each feature and dissolved adjacent buffers of the same type so the overlap was not visible. Then I did an intersection to show the area that all of these requirements are met in. A map with and without the intersect is shown, since not every potential resident would care about each of these features.</h3>
